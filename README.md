<h4>Insertion Sort : </h4>

Algorithm:

Step 1 − If the element is the first one, it is already sorted.

Step 2 – Move to next element

Step 3 − Compare the current element with all elements in the sorted array

Step 4 – If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, iterate to the next element. Otherwise, shift all the greater element in the array by one position towards the right

Step 5 − Insert the value at the correct position

Step 6 − Repeat until the complete list is sorted

***Time Complexity for the program on Insertion Sort***
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
